# TIR Browser Sample Application - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

This sample application has been successfully implemented as the **reference implementation** for TIR Browser Platform development standards. All core phases have been completed.

### 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

**✅ MANDATORY TIR Browser Standards Implemented:**

1. **Correlation ID Management**
   - Exact format: `cid-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
   - Automatic generation at entry points
   - Propagation to all service calls
   - Validation middleware

2. **Structured Logging**
   - JSON format with all mandatory fields
   - Loki integration with winston-loki
   - File fallback when Loki unavailable
   - Log rotation (100MB max, 5 files)
   - Business event logging with eventType

3. **Service Authentication**
   - JWT tokens with shared secret
   - 5-minute token expiration
   - Service-to-service authentication middleware
   - User authentication support

4. **Health Checks**
   - `/health` - Basic health check
   - `/ready` - ALB readiness check
   - `/status` - Detailed status information
   - `/live` - Kubernetes-style liveness probe
